# wikipedia-clickstream
In this project, I use the [Wikipedia Clickstream Data Dump](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/clickstream/) to simulate a real-time data stream using Apache Kafka for ingestion, Apache Flink for processing, PostgreSQL for data storage, Metabase for real-time analytics, and Docker-Compose for orchestration. Additionally, I used [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/)  to generate fake user data, enriching clickstream dataset with realistic user information.
